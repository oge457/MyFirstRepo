What I have learned from this courseSo far in this course I have learned the basics of Git and GitHub workflows, including creating repositories, branching, committing, and opening pull requests. Practically applying these tools has helped me understand version control and collaboration—I can now track changes, revert mistakes, and work with others with confidence.
